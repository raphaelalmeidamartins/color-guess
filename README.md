## :page_with_curl: About

Project of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript developed by me ([Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/)) at the end of the Unit 5 Module 1 of the Web Development course at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com). I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We had to develop a color guess game. The user needs to guess which color from a randomly generated palette corresponds to the RGB value displayed on the screen. If they get it right, they earn 3 points. The points accumulate in every hit.
